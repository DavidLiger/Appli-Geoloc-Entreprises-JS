This application uses "Leaflet" and "Mapbox" APIs to display and interact with a map. 
Here a succession of zoom and markers allow you to retrieve lists of companies attached to each of the 250 agencies. 
"Actual Intérim" of the territory, from a table of more than 100,000 lines.

An interface enables branch managers to set a target to be achieved with each of these companies. 
and allows management to monitor the achievement of these objectives.
